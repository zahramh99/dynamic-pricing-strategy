![Project Banner](assets/images/banner.png)  <!-- Optional -->

## Overview
Dynamic Pricing is an application of data science that involves adjusting the prices of a product or service based on various factors in real time. This project implements a dynamic pricing strategy for a ride-sharing service using Python.

## Features
- Data analysis and visualization
- Dynamic pricing algorithm implementation
- Machine learning model for price prediction
- Profitability analysis



## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook for exploratory analysis:
jupyter notebook notebooks/dynamic_pricing_analysis.ipynb
To train the model:
python src/model_training.py
To make predictions:
python src/predict.py

## Data :
The dataset used in this project contains information about:
Number of riders
Number of drivers
Vehicle type
Expected ride duration
Historical cost of rides

## Results : 
Our dynamic pricing strategy achieved [X]% improvement in profitability compared to fixed pricing.
